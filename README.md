#  AlSalmi-DFT-QMC-python

AlSalmi-DFT-QMC-Python is your open-source gateway to understanding the fundamental concepts behind two powerful electronic structure calculation methods: Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). This lightweight code is designed for accessibility and clarity, making it the perfect tool to:

1-Grasp the core principles of DFT and QMC, the workhorses of modern materials science and chemistry.
2-Gain hands-on experience with practical implementations of these techniques.

3-Explore the inner workings of electronic structure calculations, from basic formulas to real-world applications.

Why QMC-DFT-Python?

1-Focus on understanding: Code complexity is kept minimal, prioritizing conceptual clarity over advanced features.
2-Perfect for learning: Ideal for an advanced undergraduate scientific computing course, fostering deeper discussions and practical insights.
3-Open-source and evolving: Contribute to the project, share your knowledge, and shape the future of the code.
